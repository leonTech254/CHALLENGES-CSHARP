# CHALLENGES-CSHARP
    Inheritance
    Implement a base class "Shape" and derive classes like Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. Add methods to calculate the area and perimeter for each shape.

    Polymorphism
    Create an interface "ISound" with a method "MakeSound()". Implement this interface in classes representing different animals. Demonstrate polymorphism by calling the "MakeSound()" method on objects of different classes.

    Encapsulation
    Design a class representing a bank account. Use encapsulation to protect sensitive information like balance. Include methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance.

    Abstraction
    Create an abstract class "Vehicle" with properties like speed and methods like "Start()" and "Stop()". Derive classes like Car, Bicycle, and Plane. Implement the abstract methods in each derived class.

    Composition
    Build a class representing a "Library" that contains a list of "Book" objects. Use composition to model the relationship between the Library and Book classes.

    Interface Implementation
    Define an interface "ILogger" with methods like "LogInfo()", "LogWarning()", and "LogError()". Implement this interface in classes representing different logging mechanisms (e.g., FileLogger, ConsoleLogger).

    Static Members
    Create a class with a static member to keep track of the number of instances created. Demonstrate how the static member is incremented when objects are instantiated.

    Event Handling
    Design a class that generates events (e.g., a Button class). Create a subscriber class that listens to these events and performs some action when the event is triggered.

    Generic Classes
    Build a generic stack class that can store elements of any data type. Implement methods for pushing, popping, and checking if the stack is empty.
